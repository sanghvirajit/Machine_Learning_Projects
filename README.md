# Machine Learning Projects

These machine learning projects are part of the on-going machine learning zoomcamp offered by DataTalks.Club, by Alexey Grigorev, Principle Data Scientist at OLX Group, Berlin.

In all the projects, following task were performed

**Part 1** - Data Processing : Cleaning and Transforming Raw Data into the Understandable Format

**Part 2** - Profiling : Data profiling is the process of examining the data available from an existing information source (e.g. a database or a file) and collecting statistics or informative summaries about that data.

**Part 3** - Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA: Finding insights from the Data

**Part 4** - Building the different model like Logistic Regresion, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost and tuning it's hyperparameters.

**Part 5** - Selecting the Best Model

**Part 6** - **Model Deployment - Deploying the model on AWS Cloud**
